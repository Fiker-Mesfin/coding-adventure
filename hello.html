    Hello, world!
    <p>
      The soft hum of the city filled the air as the sun dipped below the
      horizon, painting the buildings in shades of orange and gold. People
      hurried along the sidewalks, each lost in their own world â€” some smiling
      at their phones, others deep in thought. A cool breeze carried the scent
      of coffee and rain, weaving through the streets and alleys. In that brief
      moment between day and night, the city seemed to pause, caught in a quiet
      balance between chaos and calm.
